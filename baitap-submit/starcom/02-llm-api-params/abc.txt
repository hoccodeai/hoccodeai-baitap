The Singapore Football Association (FAS) has allocated only 70 tickets to Vietnamese fans for the first leg of the 2024 ASEAN Cup semifinals at Jalan Besar Stadium on Thursday, instead of the 300 initially planned.
Singapore played their group stage matches at the 55,000-seat Singapore National Stadium. However, due to four scheduled music events from Dec. 21 to 29, the semifinal was moved to the smaller Jalan Besar Stadium, which has a capacity of just 6,000.

The 2024 ASEAN Cup regulations require the host team to provide 1,250 tickets to tournament organizers and main sponsors. Another 400 tickets are reserved for players and coaching staff from both teams. After other mandatory allocations, only about 4,000 tickets were available for public sale of this game.

At least 8% of these tickets are went to the tournament's television rights holders, while another 8% are set aside for away fans. On Dec. 21, the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) announced plans to sell approximately 300 tickets directly to Vietnamese fans at Jalan Besar Stadium on match day. However, on Tuesday, FAS canceled this plan and allocated the tickets through the Vietnam Football Federation (VFF) instead.
